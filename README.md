# RPI-generator
A macro-enabled XLS for generating RPI for any sports league or game with win-loss records.

##How it works
Download the XLS file and open in Excel. You'll see a number of hidden tabs once you activate macros (note: there is some risk to this, but the file is clean.) You'll want to activate the "Work" tab, where you input the results from your games, with winner and loser in each line. Scores are not important, as this file does not calculate RPI to include home or away bonuses.

Once you've done this, go to the RPI Output tab. 

In order to view your teams, you'll need to use the sort menu (right click) by Row Labels. Choose all of your teams inside of this area. Once you've done this, click on Refresh and your RPI data will appear. Other tabs display Opponents Win % and Opponents Opponents Win %.
